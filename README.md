# Exercism Go Track Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the Go track on Exercism.org. Each directory corresponds to an individual Exercism Go exercise.

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a platform offering code practice and mentorship. The Go track provides a structured learning path for Go.

### [My Exercism Profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/moceviciusda)

## Progress

This repository is updated as I complete new exercises. The commit history reflects my personal Go learning process. While each solution passes Exercism's tests, they may not be the most optimal or idiomatic Go code.
